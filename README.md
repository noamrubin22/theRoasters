My project
The most efficient timetable needs to be created for the students of UvA Science park.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
These scripts are written in Python3.6.3. The requirements.txt consists of the needed packages to run the code successfully. Those are easy to install throuw pip with the following instruction: 

pip install -r requirements.txt

Structure
All python scripts are in the "code" directory. The "data" directory consists out of the input values and the "results" directory holds the created timetables. 

Testing
To test the code use the instruction:

python3 lectures.py
