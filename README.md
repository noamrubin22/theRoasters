# My project
The most efficient schedule needs to be created for the students of UvA Science Park.

## Getting Started
These scripts are written in Python 3.6.3. The requirements.txt consists of the needed packages to run the code successfully.

### Prerequisites
The required packages are easily installed through:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install matplotlib
```

### Structure
All python scripts are in the "code" directory. The "data" directory consists out of the input values and the "results" directory holds the created timetables.

### Testing
To test the code use the instruction:

```
python3 main.py
```

Or, if you already have Python 3.0 > installed:

```
python main.py
```
